## [Step 02] — GoogleTest wiring & smoke test (2026-04-16)

### What
- Added `cmake/FetchGoogleTest.cmake`, which pulls GoogleTest v1.15.2
  via `FetchContent` and then `include(GoogleTest)`s the CMake stdlib
  module that provides `gtest_discover_tests`.
- Added a `KNNG_BUILD_TESTS` option (defaulting to `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL`)
  and gated testing behind both it and CTest's `BUILD_TESTING` — so
  downstream consumers that pull `knng` via `FetchContent` do not drag
  GoogleTest into their build.
- Added `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and `tests/smoke_test.cpp`. The smoke
  test exercises the full "GoogleTest → `knng::headers` → generated
  `knng/version.hpp`" chain with three cases: non-negative macros,
  dotted string matches component macros, string is non-empty.
- `gtest_discover_tests` registers each `TEST()` with CTest; a labeled
  `smoke` group makes targeted invocation (`ctest -L smoke`) possible
  as the test corpus grows.
- Verified end-to-end: clean `cmake -B build`, `cmake --build build`,
  then `ctest` → **3 tests passed, 0 failed** on AppleClang 21.

### Why
Without a live test harness from Day 2, every later algorithmic step
would be verified only by eyeballing `hello_knng` output. Bolting on
tests "later" is how every project ends up with a pile of untested
code — the cost of slipping in a regression is minimized by catching
it the same day it's written, which requires CTest to already be
working. Fetching GoogleTest via `FetchContent` keeps the toolchain
requirements self-contained: a fresh clone + CMake + a C++20 compiler
is the entire setup story, no distro packages, no vcpkg.

### Tradeoff
- **FetchContent, not system GoogleTest.** An initial experiment using
  `FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS NAMES GTest` preferred Homebrew's
  `libgtest_main.1.11.0.dylib`, whose rpath is not embedded in our
  test binaries — `gtest_discover_tests` then failed at build time
  because the runtime loader couldn't find the dylib. Always-fetching
  trades ~20 MB of disk and a one-time git clone for a deterministic,
  static-linked, rpath-free test binary. Given the project's
  "pinned dependencies, reproducible builds" stance, this was the
  right call.
- **Filename: `FetchGoogleTest.cmake`, not `GoogleTest.cmake`.** The
  obvious name collides with the CMake stdlib module that defines
  `gtest_discover_tests`; when our module was first on the
  `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`, the stdlib module was shadowed and the
  function was undefined. Renaming is the cleanest fix.
- **No `gtest_main` → custom `main` yet.** Linking `GTest::gtest_main`
  is the fast path but forecloses on things like custom fixture-global
  setup or GPU-context initialization. When those land, we'll switch
  to `GTest::gtest` + a project-owned `main.cpp`. Not needed yet.
- **GoogleTest compiled without `knng_set_warnings`.** Upstream does
  not build cleanly under `-Wconversion -Werror` (in fact this very
  build emitted a `-Wcharacter-conversion` warning from
  `gtest-printers.h`). Applying our strictness to third-party code
  would be a maintenance burden with no payoff.

### Learning
- `FetchContent_MakeAvailable` with `FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS` is elegant in
  principle but punts environment-specific rpath/link issues onto
  whoever configures the project. For a young project, the
  "always-build-from-source" path is markedly less surprising.
- The CMake module resolution order (`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` before the
  stdlib modules directory) is a sharp edge. Naming a local helper
  after a stdlib module silently replaces the stdlib module — and
  `include_guard(GLOBAL)` ensures the stdlib version never loads
  even when included later. Pick names that cannot collide.
- `gtest_discover_tests` runs the test binary at *build* time to
  enumerate `TEST()` cases. Anything that prevents the binary from
  launching (missing dylibs, uninitialized globals, forbidden syscalls
  under CI sandboxing) becomes a build-time error, not a test-time
  error — loud, but occasionally confusing.
- `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` (CMake ≥ 3.21) is the right knob for "opt
  into tests when we're the root project, opt out when we're a
  subdirectory of someone else's build."

### Next
Step 3 will introduce the `knng_core` library target — a header-only
scaffold for the public API surface (distance types, graph types,
seed point for future CPU reference code) — and prove that tests
can link it alongside `GTest::gtest_main` without disturbing the
current warning policy.

## [Step 01] — Repository skeleton & CMake build system (2026-04-16)

### What
- Added a root `CMakeLists.txt` that defines the `knng` project
  (version 0.1.0, C++20, warnings-as-errors, Release-by-default).
- Added `cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake` providing a `knng_set_warnings()`
  helper that applies the project-wide warning policy to any target.
- Added `cmake/version.hpp.in`, a CMake-configured header that exposes
  `KNNG_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/STRING` macros to C++ code.
- Added an `knng::headers` INTERFACE library that carries the public
  include path (`include/` plus the generated-header directory) so that
  every later target only needs to link this one dependency to pick up
  the public API.
- Added `tools/hello_knng.cpp`, a tiny smoke-test executable that prints
  the library version, compiler, build type, and host platform.
- Added `.gitignore` (build trees, downloaded datasets, benchmark outputs,
  IDE/OS cruft, and the local-only `LLNL Internship Preparation/` notes
  folder).
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT) and a top-level `README.md` that frames the project
  and explains the build.

### Why
Before writing any algorithmic code, the project needs a build system that
is (1) strict about warnings, (2) self-documenting about configuration,
(3) friendly to IDEs and clang-tooling, and (4) generic enough to absorb
the many subsystems (CPU, GPU, MPI, NCCL, Python bindings) that later
steps will introduce. Pinning these invariants on Day 1 means no later
commit has to renegotiate them. `hello_knng` exists so the build can be
exercised end-to-end from Step 1 — without a runnable artifact, build
breakage would be invisible until Step 6 or later.

### Tradeoff
- **Warnings-as-errors from Day 1.** This will occasionally block
  a build on compiler-version upgrades. Mitigated by the
  `-DKNNG_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF` escape hatch. The alternative — flipping
  it on late — inevitably results in hundreds of pre-existing warnings
  that nobody wants to audit.
- **C++20 minimum.** Rules out older toolchains (pre-GCC 11, pre-Clang 14).
  Acceptable: all target platforms (modern Linux HPC, recent macOS, modern
  Windows) ship C++20-capable compilers. Buys us `std::span`, ranges,
  `consteval`, concepts, improved `<bit>`, etc. — all of which will earn
  their keep later.
- **`knng::headers` as an INTERFACE target.** A slightly heavier pattern
  than dumping include directories globally, but it scales cleanly once
  there are dozens of targets and it's the shape every modern CMake guide
  recommends.

### Learning
- Modern CMake (≥ 3.20) has matured significantly: `target_*` commands,
  INTERFACE libraries, and `configure_file` with `@ONLY` replacement give
  a clean way to separate public headers, generated headers, and compile
  options without polluting global state.
- `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON` is effectively free and makes every
  modern editor (VS Code, Neovim, Zed, CLion) immediately understand the
  project.
- Centralizing warning flags in a helper function, rather than repeating
  them per target, is the difference between a codebase where strictness
  compounds and one where it erodes.

### Next
Step 2 will wire GoogleTest via `FetchContent` and add a `tests/` directory
with a smoke-test, confirming that `ctest` runs cleanly in-tree and in CI.
