# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, one entry per
development step. Entries are ordered newest-first and follow the structure:

```

The goal of this document is pedagogical: each entry should make the *why*
of the change obvious to a reader scanning the history, independent of the
code diff.

## [Step 01] — Repository skeleton & CMake build system (2026-04-16)

### What
- Added a root `CMakeLists.txt` that defines the `knng` project
  (version 0.1.0, C++20, warnings-as-errors, Release-by-default).
- Added `cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake` providing a `knng_set_warnings()`
  helper that applies the project-wide warning policy to any target.
- Added `cmake/version.hpp.in`, a CMake-configured header that exposes
  `KNNG_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/STRING` macros to C++ code.
- Added an `knng::headers` INTERFACE library that carries the public
  include path (`include/` plus the generated-header directory) so that
  every later target only needs to link this one dependency to pick up
  the public API.
- Added `tools/hello_knng.cpp`, a tiny smoke-test executable that prints
  the library version, compiler, build type, and host platform.
- Added `.gitignore` (build trees, downloaded datasets, benchmark outputs,
  IDE/OS cruft, and the local-only `LLNL Internship Preparation/` notes
  folder).
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT) and a top-level `README.md` that frames the project
  and explains the build.

### Why
Before writing any algorithmic code, the project needs a build system that
is (1) strict about warnings, (2) self-documenting about configuration,
(3) friendly to IDEs and clang-tooling, and (4) generic enough to absorb
the many subsystems (CPU, GPU, MPI, NCCL, Python bindings) that later
steps will introduce. Pinning these invariants on Day 1 means no later
commit has to renegotiate them. `hello_knng` exists so the build can be
exercised end-to-end from Step 1 — without a runnable artifact, build
breakage would be invisible until Step 6 or later.

### Tradeoff
- **Warnings-as-errors from Day 1.** This will occasionally block
  a build on compiler-version upgrades. Mitigated by the
  `-DKNNG_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF` escape hatch. The alternative — flipping
  it on late — inevitably results in hundreds of pre-existing warnings
  that nobody wants to audit.
- **C++20 minimum.** Rules out older toolchains (pre-GCC 11, pre-Clang 14).
  Acceptable: all target platforms (modern Linux HPC, recent macOS, modern
  Windows) ship C++20-capable compilers. Buys us `std::span`, ranges,
  `consteval`, concepts, improved `<bit>`, etc. — all of which will earn
  their keep later.
- **`knng::headers` as an INTERFACE target.** A slightly heavier pattern
  than dumping include directories globally, but it scales cleanly once
  there are dozens of targets and it's the shape every modern CMake guide
  recommends.

### Learning
- Modern CMake (≥ 3.20) has matured significantly: `target_*` commands,
  INTERFACE libraries, and `configure_file` with `@ONLY` replacement give
  a clean way to separate public headers, generated headers, and compile
  options without polluting global state.
- `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON` is effectively free and makes every
  modern editor (VS Code, Neovim, Zed, CLion) immediately understand the
  project.
- Centralizing warning flags in a helper function, rather than repeating
  them per target, is the difference between a codebase where strictness
  compounds and one where it erodes.

### Next
Step 2 will wire GoogleTest via `FetchContent` and add a `tests/` directory
with a smoke-test, confirming that `ctest` runs cleanly in-tree and in CI.
